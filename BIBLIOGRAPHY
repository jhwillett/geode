Bibliography for Geode, Copyright 2003 (C) Jesse H. Willett

This contains a list of sources I have consulted while working
on this project.  As this is an ASCII text document, I have
indiscriminately used quotation marks to indicate titles of both
books and articles.

So far, I'm trying to err on the side of this list being too long,
not too short.
